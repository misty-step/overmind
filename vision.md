# Vision

## One-Liner
Portfolio command center CLI for indie hackers - traffic, health, revenue at a glance.

## North Star
A world-class, Stripe-level TUI that's the first thing you check in the morning. Clean, stable, delightful. The kind of tool that makes people say "holy shit, this is beautiful."

## Key Differentiators
- CLI-native, not a web dashboard bolted onto terminal
- Zero config friction - works with your existing PostHog/Stripe/Sentry setup
- Glanceable - see your whole portfolio in one view
- Opinionated about what matters: traffic, MRR, health status

## Target User
Indie hackers running multiple projects who live in the terminal. People who'd rather `overmind` than open five browser tabs.

## Current Focus
Ship a tight, stable CLI with:
- Traffic metrics (PostHog)
- MRR and subscriber counts (Stripe)
- Health check status
- Sentry integration (errors at a glance)

Polish > features. Make it delightful.

## Future Options
- Open source on GitHub (likely path)
- If it works, could explore paid features or hosted version later
- Keep CLI as the core, web dashboard only if there's demand
